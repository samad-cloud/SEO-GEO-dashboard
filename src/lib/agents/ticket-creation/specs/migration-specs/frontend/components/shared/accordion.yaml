name: Accordion
source: components/share/accordion/accordion.tsx
description: >
  Simple accordion container component that wraps accordion items (header + details pairs).
  Provides a semantic wrapper div with ARIA tablist role. Does not manage expand/collapse
  state itself -- state management is handled by the parent component via props passed
  to AccordionHeader and AccordionDetails children.

    required: true
    description: >
      Unique identifier for the accordion container. Set as the DOM id attribute
      on the wrapper div.

component_structure:
  root: div
  attributes:
    id: props.id
    role: tablist
    aria-multiselectable: "false"
  children: Slot (renders whatever children are passed)

      Qwik's content projection mechanism. In Next.js, this maps to React children prop.

data_structure: {}

behavior:
  rendering:
    - Renders a single div with id, role="tablist", and aria-multiselectable="false"
    - All children are projected through Slot (content projection)
  state_management:
    - This component does NOT manage accordion state (expanded/collapsed)
    - Parent component is responsible for tracking which sections are expanded
    - Parent passes expanded state and onChange handlers to AccordionHeader/AccordionDetails children
  accessibility:
    - role="tablist" identifies this as a tab-like widget to assistive technologies
    - aria-multiselectable="false" indicates only one panel should be expanded at a time

styling:
  framework: Tailwind CSS
  classes: none
  description: No styling applied -- pure structural/semantic wrapper

dependencies:
  - "@builder.io/qwik": Slot, component$

used_by:
  - components/footer/footer-containerless.tsx (footer navigation accordion)
  - components/footer/footer.tsx
  - components/footer/footer-product-category.tsx
  - components/footer/footer-canvas.tsx
  - components/footer/footer-auth.tsx
  - Various FAQ and product detail page accordions

security:
  - No security concerns -- pure structural wrapper with no user input or data handling

notes:
  - Despite aria-multiselectable="false", the actual single-expand enforcement is done by the parent, not this component
  - In a Next.js migration, Slot maps to React's children prop pattern
  - This component is intentionally minimal -- all behavior lives in AccordionHeader and AccordionDetails
